## Competitions

Pebble allows you to run virtually any type of competition you can imagine. Competition types that Pebble supports include:

- **Bouldering Leagues**: team competitions with multiple rounds, run across multiple weeks that can be scored based on a climber's ability.
- **Citizen Comps**: individual competitions with categories and scored without using judges or using other competitors as judges.
- **World Cup**: Formal comps with specific users of Pebble set up as judges and a scoring system similar to World Cup/Olympic scoring.

All settings are configurable, so you can tailor the comp to fit the culture of your gym. Checkout the [Creating a Comp](/competitions/create-comp) section to get started.
