## Competitions

Pebble allows you to run virtually any type of competition you can imagine. Competition types that Pebble supports include:

- **Bouldering Leagues**: team competitions with multiple rounds, run across multiple weeks that can be scored based on a climber's ability.
- **Citizen Comps**: individual competitions with categories and scored without using judges or using other competitors as judges.
- **World Cup**: Formal comps with specific users of Pebble set up as judges and a scoring system similar to World Cup/Olympic scoring.
- **Modified Redpoint**: Competitions with zone and tops like a World Cup round, but competitors are allowed to try the climbs whenever they want within an allotted time.

All settings are configurable, so you can tailor the comp to fit the culture of your gym. Checkout the [Creating a Comp](/competitions/create-comp) section to get started.

#### Testing Competitions

Most competitions run in a very short time period and there's no room for learning on the fly. Therefore, we suggest testing out Pebble's competition features before the competition begins. You can create a hidden competition and invite employees of your gym to test out the formats you plan to use for each round of the competition.

#### Limitations

Pebble tries to be as flexible as possible, but there are some limitations that you should be aware of when creating comps.

- A user can only create one competitor for a given comp. If a parent is signing up a child for the comp using the parent's account, they can't use the same account to sign themselves up as a competitor.
- A Pebble user can't be a judge and a competitor in the same round if the round is using formal judges (ex: a finals round).
- When creating a finals round, create separate rounds for each category.

#### Internet Issues

The internet is a wiley beast that can often break. We do our best to mitigate this by testing the app regularly and hosting our servers on Amazon's servers with multiple failsafes in place. But, we can't guarantee 100% uptime because no one can. In the extremely unlikely event that the internet or our servers go down, we suggest creating a backup plan.

#### Other Issues

We've often seen that a competitor will show us their app and the competition round is not showing up in their leaderboard. This is almost always because they signed up for the competition with a different account than the one they are currently signed into the app with. Encourage them to try loggging out and logging in with a different account.
