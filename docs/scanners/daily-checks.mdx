## Daily Scanner Checks

Scanners will occasionally get covered and shut down or run out of battery. Pebble tries it's best to alert head setters of any issues, however setters aren't always able to immediately attend to a scanner issue. We suggest having an employee check the scanner error list in the app at the beginning of the day and reset or switch out any scanners that have logged errors.

In order to check the scanner list, any Pebble user with employee permissions or greater can switch the app to "Admin Mode" by long pressing the profile tab as outlined here: [Admin Mode](/routesetting/setting-mode). Once in Admin Mode, the scanner list can be accessed by tapping the "Scanners" tab at the bottom of the app. You can then tap on the "Sorted By" button to sort the list by error code. Check out the error code table here: [Scanner Error Codes](/scanners/handling-errors) for what to do. Usually just resetting the scanner will fix the issue.
