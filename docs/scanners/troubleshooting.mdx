## Troubleshooting

Below are some common issues and their solutions. If you have an issue that isn't listed here, please contact Pebble and we'll help you out.

### After resetting an area, all of the scanners are showing "constantly tripping" error codes.

You forgot to archive the area before taking the scanners off the wall. You can either ignore the error and the error will clear the next time you use the scanner, or tap on the scanner row in the app, and then tap the "Clear Error" button.

### A scanner is constantly tripping and shutting down. 

Make sure the scanner is in a place where it isn't being covered by an auto-belay tarp, people aren't accidentally leaning against it for more than a few minutes, or the scanner is otherwise being covered. Also, make sure the scanner is attached to a vertical or overhanging surface so that chalk or dust does not accumulate on the scannerâ€™s proximity sensor in the center hole. Blow out any dust in this hole with compressed air.  Finally, check that no wires inside the scanner are covering the motion sensor by looking in the center hole and pushing them out of the way if necessary.

After making sure the proximity sensor isn't blocked or cleaning it off, press the reset button to reset the error.

### A scanner takes a long time to log a send and the green LED stays on for a long time.

Make sure the scanner is close enough to at least one of your gateways. If you can't move the scanner, move one of your gateway's to a closer location or add another gateway to your gym.

### A scanner successfully reads your wristband, but you don't see the send in the app or, if in discovery mode, the scanner doesn't show up in the app.

Make sure you're wristband is connected to your account. If you're not sure, scan your wristband by tapping the "Wristband Info" button and scanning it to see if it is connected to your account.

### A scanner shows no battery life, but still works. 

This is probably a hardware issue and the scanner needs to be replaced. Please contact Pebble and get a replacement scanner.

### A scanner is blinking quickly and not logging sends.

This is probably a hardware issue and the scanner needs to be replaced. Please contact Pebble and get a replacement scanner.

### None of the scanners are working and all show red LED errors after trying to scan.

Check that all of your gateways are showing a red and blue light. If they are showing two red lights, that means they can't connect to the internet. You may need to go through the gateway setup again, outlined in the [Setting up the gateways](/scanners/gateways) section.
