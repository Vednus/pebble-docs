## Handling errors and Low-battery Warnings

The Pebble app allows you to manage errors and low-battery warnings. A notification will be sent to all head setters whenever a scanner throws an error or a low-battery warning. Additionally, anyone with employee, manager, or setter permissions can view scanners with errors and sort by battery level and signal stength.

### Viewing scanners with errors or low-battery warnings

Make sure your app is in "Setter/Manager" mode, and tap on the "Scanners" tab. This will show a list of your scanners, sorted by battery level. You can use this to replace any scanenrs with a low battery. By tapping the "Sorted by" button, you can also view signal stength and error code. When viewing scanners by "Error code", you will only see a list of scanners that have an error associated with them. 

### Possible error codes

### Replacing a scanner if it's broken or the battery is low.

1. Unscrew the scanner from the wall and replace it with a newly charged scanner.
2. Tap on the row of the scanner that you replaced and tap the "Change Scanner" button.
3. Scan your wristband at the new scanner to connect it to the climb.
