## Send Scanners

Scanners without a climb or activity assigned will default to being "send" scanners. After a member scans their bracelet at a scanner associated with a climb, an attempt is logged in the Pebble app. If they successfully complete the climb, they can tap their wristband to a "send" scanner and turn their last attempt into a send.

### Placement

We've found that the best place for send scanners is on the wall near the other climb scanners. This way, members can scan their wristband at the climb scanner, then, when they complete the climb, walk over to the send scanner and tap their wristband to log a send. But, feel free to experiment with placement. Each gym is unique and depending on your layout, you may find a different placement works better for you.

Make sure the scanner is placed vertically so that the proximity sensor isn't susceptible to chalk or members leaning on it so that it doesn't shut down. See the [scanner featues](/scanner/features) page for more information about the proximity sensor.
