## Getting Info About and Editing a Scanner

Using your wristband, you can get information about a scanner and edit the scanner's associated activity.

Scan the wristband linked to your account to the scanner that you want information on. This will bring up a screen with information about the scanner, including the scanner's name, battery power, signal strength, and the scanner's activity and associated climb, if one.
