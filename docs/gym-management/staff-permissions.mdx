<VideoPlaylist videoId="X-MzU7gtwNs" />

Once you've created your gym, it's time to give other users access to your gym on Pebble. The Gym Permissions section can be reached by clicking on the icon below next to the gym name on the gym page.

### Adding Users

When adding users, make sure to only add the users you need, especially when it comes to Gym Managers and Head Route-setters. These users have the ability to change and adjust major features of your gym on Pebble.

On the gym permissions page, add an email and click on the checkmarks beside this email that correspond to the permission you wish to give that user.

<strong>
  You may want to ask anyone you plan on adding as a manager or setter whether
  they already have a Pebble account and if so, what email they are using. This
  ensures that they can use the same account as both a climber on Pebble and a
  manager or setter.

There are 4 permission levels

- **Managers** - Managers have the ability to edit the gym and create and edit gym areas. They can also send out News and events about the gym to any followers of that gym.

- **Representatives** - Representatives publicly represent the gym on Pebble. They will get a little badge by their image in the app that is the gym's logo. The only extra feature that representatives have is that they can create curated workouts.

- **Head Setters** - Head Setters can create gym distributions and assign draft climbs to any other setters. They can also archive a gym area when it's time to reset and view all other setters' feedback. Depending on your gym's employee structure, you may want to give head setters the additional Manager permission. You may also want to give all your setters the role of head setter. Pebble allows users to have more than one role.

- **Setters** - Setters have the ability to check out and publish climbs. They can be limited by a maximum grade they're allowed to checkout.

<strong>
  Once you've added all your users, make sure to scroll down and save them.
</strong>

All of your users will get an email either asking them to signup for Pebble or letting them know that they have been added as a manager or setter at your gym.
