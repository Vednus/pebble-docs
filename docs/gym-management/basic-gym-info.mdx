## Basic Gym Information

The first section of the form used to create a gym is focused on your basic gym information.

Each of these sections should be self-explanatory.

The "Go Live" switch should be switched on once you have created your gym and added the areas and all your route setters have added the current climbs in your gym to Pebble.

Any users you have added via the gym permissions can see your gym regardless of whether it is live, but in order for all users of Pebble to see your gym, you must switch on the "Go Live" switch.
