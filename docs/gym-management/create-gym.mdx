## Creating and Editing a Gym

As a subscribing member of Pebble, you can create up to 3 gyms. If you need to create more than 3 gyms, please contact Pebble at [support@pebbleclimbing.com](mailto:support@pebbleclimbing.com).

Navigate to [https://www.pebbleclimbing.com/create/gym](https://www.pebbleclimbing.com/create/gym) to create your first gym.

You'll notice that the last 2 sections are disabled. These are more advanced sections and require that your gym is created before setting these up. So go through the first 2 sections and then, if you wish to set-up Rock Gym Pro integration to monitor setting efficiency, you can go back to these sections by editing your gym after it's been created.

Once you have created a gym, you can come back to the same form page to edit your gym by clicking on the pencil icon next to the gym name on the gym's page.
