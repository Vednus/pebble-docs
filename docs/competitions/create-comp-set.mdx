## Creating a Round for a Competition

Comp rounds are defined by a time where a group of competitors can log scores and a set of climbs which competitors can try to complete. Rounds could be the problems set for a weekly round in a bouldering league, all the climbs in the gym for a citizens comp, or a single finals route round for the pro division of a more formal comp. It's a way of organizing the competition into groups that have similar scoring and timeline constraints.
Make sure you have already added the climbs that are part of the competition as you would any other climb in Pebble. If you haven't done that and are wondering how, please refer to the [Route Setting](/route-setting) section of this documentation.

### 1. Login to Pebble as a head routesetter.

Make sure you are logged in to [pebbleclimbing.com](https://pebbleclimbing.com) as a head routesetter. To gain access please contact the person that signed you up for Pebble at your gym or any other user with managerial permissions on Pebble.

### 2. Navigate to the page representing the competition you are setting routes for and click the "Add a Round" button.

### 3. On the next page, fill out the form to create a new comp round.

#### Comp Round Details

- **Name** your new comp round.
- Define the start and end **dates** for when competitors are allowed to log a score for the climbs. **We suggest starting the round slightly before you announce it to the competitors so that their apps are sure to allow them to score the climbs in the round.**
- Choose whether to allow climbers in the gym climb on the climbs before the round. The only time you might want to switch this on is if it's a bouldering league type comp and users of the gym might be climbing on these problems before the bouldering league round starts and the competitors could climb on them if they wanted.
- If you want to have **Sponsored Climbs**, or climbs where you can choose a winner for a prize from anyone who sent this climb, turn this option on.

#### Scoring Details

- If you want to use **World Cup Scoring** for this round, select the appropriate scoring system based on whether the round has routes or boulder problems.
- Choose which **competitors** are allowed to compete in this round. You can allow everyone, certain categories, or invite specific competitors if it's a semi/final round.
  - If only competitors in certain categories are chosen, choose those **categories** for this round.
  - If competitors from this round should be manually chosen, choose the competitors. You can either use a previous round's leaderboard to select competitors or find competitors that have registered for the comp.

- Choose how you want the climbs to be judged.

  - **Open** - no judging is needed and any sends (and attempts if they're scored) will automatically count as scores.
  - **Competitors** - other competitors or any users of Pebble can act as a judge for another competitor. If selected as a judge, the user will get a notification that they've judged a climb.
  - **Judges** - proper judges that you should select when editing the competition. If you haven't added judges, go back to the main comp page, click the pencil icon, scroll down to the bottom of the page and add Pebble users as judges.

- Type in the **number of climbs** that count toward your score for this round.
- Select whether you want to **Score climbs relative to a climber's ability**. If you don't see this option, then you need to go back and edit the comp to allow for this option.
- If you've decided to make this a **relative scoring** round, you'll need to define the score of each climb. I suggest leaving this as 100 or if you want, changing it to 1000 or the like.
- Click on the switch for **hold based scoring** if the scoring will be based on the highest hold reached.
- Click on the **scoring attempts** switch if attempts will count against your score and add the points to be deducted (Points must be whole numbers, decimal points won't work.).
- If you want to add **Bonus Activities** checkout the [Bonus Activities](/competitions/bonus-activities) section of this documentation.
- Choose the **Gym Areas** where the climbs for this round are set.
- Click **Create a New Comp Round**

### 4. Add climbs to the comp round.

Once you have saved your comp round, you will see all the climbs in the seleced areas appear below.

Click on the switch next to each climb to activate that climb as part of this comp round.

We strongly recommend **renaming the climbs to add a number or some other identifier that you will place on the wall** to make it easier for competitors to find the climbs.

Add a max score for each activated climb and add the number of holds that will be scored if you are scoring by holds.
