<VideoPlaylist videoId="r-FHpIpmEME" />

In order to log a score as a judge, make sure you are added to the list of judges in the competition. To do this, edit the competition page on the website as outlined in the [Edit Competition](/competitions/create-comp) section.

Once the round begins, you should see the comp and it's areas listed in the dashboard section of the app.
