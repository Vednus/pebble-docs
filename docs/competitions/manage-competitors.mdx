## Manage Competitors

The Manage competitors page allows you to edit properties of the competitors such as:

- category
- time slot
- max grade
- team

You can also dowload a list of competitors, their properties and any questions you had them answer when registering for the comp.

Login to Pebble as a manager and navigate to the comp page.

Click the "Manage Competitors" icon.

### Managing Teams

You can use this form to manage teams if the comp is a team based competition.

If you are allowing floaters, select the checkbox next to any competitor that you want to assign to a team and click **Create a team from the selected competitors** or if you want to assign them to an existing team, click **Add to an existing team**

If you need to adjust a competitor's max grade, change the max grade in the competitor's row. Note, that even if you change a score, if the competitor will get bumped according to the rules, then the max grade will be adjusted accordingly.

You can also remove a competitor from the comp. If your comp is paying using the Stripe integration, the competitor will get a refund for the cost of the comp.
