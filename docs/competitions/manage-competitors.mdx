#### 5. If you need to adjust a competitor's max grade, change the max grade in the competitor's row. Note, that even if you change a score, if the competitor will get bumped according to the rules, then the max grade will be adjusted accordingly.

#### 6. You can also remove a competitor from the comp. If your comp is paying using the Stripe integration, the competitor will get a refund for the cost of the comp.
