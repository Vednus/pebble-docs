## Manage Competitors

The Manage competitors page allows you to check in competitors and edit info such as:

- category
- time slot
- max grade
- team
- name
- underlying user


### Competition Day
This page is especially helpful on comp day when you need to check in competitors and make sure they are in the right category or connected to the right underlying user. Often parents will sign up a child on their phone, but the child has their own phone and they'll want to switch the competitor to the child's account. This page can solve most of these sorts of registration issues.

You can also dowload the list of competitors, containing whether they checked in, their info, and any questions you had them answer when registering for the comp.

Login to Pebble as a manager and navigate to the comp page.

Click the "Manage Competitors" icon.

### Managing Competitors

You can use this table to change a competitor's name, adjust their time slot, change their category, and change their underlying user.

#### Changing a competitor's underlying user
Often competitors will register for the comp with a different account than the one they are logged into the app with on comp day. This can happen if a parent registers them or if they register, delete the app, and then reinstall it. In order to quickly allow them to compete in the comp, you can figure out what their current user is and then change their competitor to this user in the table.

### Managing Teams

You can use this form to manage teams if the comp is a team based competition.

If you are allowing floaters, select the checkbox next to any competitor that you want to assign to a team and click **Create a team from the selected competitors** or if you want to assign them to an existing team, click **Add to an existing team**

If you need to adjust a competitor's max grade, change the max grade in the competitor's row. Note, that even if you change a score, if the competitor will get bumped according to the rules, then the max grade will be adjusted accordingly.

You can also remove a competitor from the comp. If your comp is paying using the Stripe integration, the competitor will get a refund for the cost of the comp.
