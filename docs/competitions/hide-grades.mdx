## Hiding Grades 

You can choose to hide the grades for specific climbs. Pebble allows you to hide grades for an entire compeitition round or for a specific climb. 


### Hiding Grades for a Competition Round
To hide grades for a specific competition round, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the competition round edit page on the website.
2. Open up the "Comp Round Details" if it's not already open when you go to the page. 
3. The hide grades toggle is under the "Othe Scoring Options".
4. Save your changes.

This will ensure that grades are not visible to competitors during the round.

**Note: Once a competitor logs a grade, it will show up in their game pyramid and in that way, they can figure out the grade of the climb.**
