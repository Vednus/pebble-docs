## Logging a Competition Score

Logging a score in Pebble is easy. Depending on the comp, you can log attempts and highest hold reached and use your friends as judges. You can also easily edit or delete a score if you mess up.

### Navigate to the Gym Area

To log a score in the app, navigate to the area in the gym where the competition is taking place. You can do this through the gym screen or through the competition screen.

### Log Your Attempts or Sends

Once you are in the area, you can see how many points each climb is worth. Log your attempts or sends by clicking on the buttons on the right of each row.

**Note:** If you don't see the little trophy icon and you are sure you've registered for the comp through Pebble as an individual or on a team, try restarting the app.

### Record a Score

After you log an attempt or send, a card will slide up from the bottom of the screen asking you to rate and grade the climb. You will also see a "Log a Score" button. Click this to log a score for the competition. Don't worry, you can always change your score if you end up sending the climb.

### Record the highest hold reached and number of tries

If you did not send the climb and the competition is giving points for the highest hold reached, you can use the image to find out which hold you got to. You can zoom in on the image if you need by pinching.

The number of tries should be populated by the number of times you attempted the climb if you are using the buttons on the climb row to record attemtps. If you see that this number is wrong, you can change it.

### Find a judge

Click on "Find a Judge" to find a judge to confirm your score. You will need to find someone that is also a member of Pebble to judge your score. Ask them to confirm your score and assign them by searching in the list that comes up and tapping on their card. They will get a notification in Pebble that they judged this climb.

### Save your score

Once you've completed the score form, click "Save" and your score will be saved and you will be brought to a screen showing you the climb you sent and your total score for the comp.

### Continue Climbing

Tap "Continue Climbing" to continue. You will now see your score on the climb row with an edit button beside it. If you want to edit or delete your score, click this button. You can also just log a new score for this climb and it will automatically override your old one.
