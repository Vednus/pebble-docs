## Logging a Competition Score

<VideoPlaylist videoId="ojdUfqbO0es" />

Logging a score in Pebble is easy. Depending on the comp, you can log attempts and highest hold reached and use your friends as judges. You can also easily edit or delete a score if you mess up.

### Navigate to the gym areas where the comp round is held

To log a score in the app, open the app and you should see the comp listed and the areas of the gym where the comp is taking place in your dashboard. Tap on one of the areas to navigate to the gym area.

**If you don't see the comp and the areas it's held, the round may not have started yet, or you may be logged in with a different account than you were when you signed up for the comp. Also make sure you have the latest version of the app.**

### Log Your Attempts or Sends

Once you are in the area, you can see how many points each climb is worth. Log your attempts or sends by clicking on the buttons on the right of each row.

### Record a Score

Depending on the rules of the round, scoring is done in different ways.

- If no judging is required and holds don't count as points, then you can simply log your attempts and sends and the app will automatically calculate your score.
- If peer judging is required and holds don't count as points, then when you press the "Score" button, you will be directed to a screen where you can choose a peer judge and record your score. (See the video at the top of this page.)
- If holds count as points, then any time you log an attempt, a card will swipe up from the bottom of the screen with a button that asks if you want to record a score.

Once you've logged your score, you can see your score by swiping up on the session card in the bottom of the screen.
