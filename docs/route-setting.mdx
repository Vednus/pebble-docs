# Customizing

The primary way for customizing this Gatsby
Theme is using
[component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/api-reference#component-shadowing).

The sidebar, header, and theme are the main intended
aspects to be customized. However, you can essentially change
anything.

## Customizing the theme

`gatsby-theme-documentation` uses a `theme.js` file to populate the
theme values. You can shadow the file at
`src/gatsby-theme-documentation/theme.js`.

```js
// src/gatsby-theme-documentation/theme.js
import baseTheme from 'gatsby-theme-documentation/src/theme'

export default {
  ...baseTheme,
  colors: {
    ...baseTheme.colors,
    text: '#111',
    background: '#fff'
  }
}
```

For a full explainer on theming you can
[see the Theme UI docs](https://theme-ui.com/).

## Customizing the sidebar

`gatsby-theme-documentation` uses a `sidebar.mdx` file to populate the navigation.
In order to customize it you can shadow it by creating a file at
`src/gatsby-theme-documentation/sidebar.mdx`.

#### Example `sidebar.mdx`

```mdx
- [Introduction](/introduction/)
- [Getting Started](/getting-started/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/johno/gatsby-theme-documentation)
```

## Customizing the header

Similarly to sidebar customization, you can also change the header content by
writing MDX. You can shadow the default header by creating a file at
`src/gatsby-theme-documentation/header.mdx`

#### Example `header.mdx`

```mdx
# ![Docs Logo](https://contrast.now.sh/white/black?width=80&height=40&text=DOCS)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/johno/gatsby-theme-documentation)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/4lpine)
```

## Adding component shortcodes

You can add shortcodes to your docs site which can be used throughout
your docs pages by extending the components passed to MDXProvider. You
can do this by using component shadowing and creating the following file
in the root of your project: `src/gatsby-theme-documentation/components.js`.

#### Example `components.js`

```js
import baseComponents from 'gatsby-theme-documentation/src/components'

import MyCustomH1 from '../components/my-custom-h1'

export default {
  ...baseComponents,
  h1: MyCustomH1
}
```
