## Pebble Climbing Documentation

<VideoPlaylist />

#### Watch each video in the playlist above to quickly get up and running on the Pebble platform.

This site serves as documentation for [Pebble Climbing](https://pebbleclimbing.com). For the most part, Pebble tries to be self-explanatory, but for more advanced features used by gym managers and route setters, this documentation aims to explain some of the more advanced features available.

Many of the features exist in both the app and the website, but initial gym setup and gym management is primarily done on the website, while route-setting is done on the app. So, you'll initially spend time on the website, but once things are set up, your route-setters will use the app to check out and publish climbs to the app.
