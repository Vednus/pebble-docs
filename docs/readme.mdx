This documentation covers the key features and functionality of Pebble Climbing. While Pebble is designed to be intuitive for most users, this guide focuses on the advanced features that gym managers and route setters need to effectively operate their climbing facility.

#### Platform Overview
Pebble operates across both web and mobile platforms, with each optimized for specific workflows:

**Website:** Used primarily for initial gym setup, route setting configuration, competition management, and member messaging. This is where gym managers and head setters can set up their gym, manage staff permissions, and configure the route-setting workflow.

**Mobile App:** The primary tool for route setters to view their schedule and publish climbs for members to discover and track.

Once your gym is configured through the website, your route-setting team will use the mobile app for their day-to-day workflow.
