3. Click on "Route Setting Configuration" to edit the route setting settings.
4. Scroll down and adjust the minimum and maximum grade and use the plus and minus buttons to define how many climbs of each grade you want to have in this area. (Note: depending on whether you are grading by color or whether this area has problems, routes or both, your screen may look different than the image below.)
