## Notifying users of a new set

Once all climbs are set in an area and the final climb is published, Pebble will automatically send out a notification to all users subscribed to the gym that
the area has been reset. You must publish all climbs, so make sure you don't leave any climbs as drafts or the notification won't go out.
