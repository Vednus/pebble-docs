## Creating a Set of Climbs for an Area in the Gym

Create a grade distribution using either the web or app via these instructions [Grade Distribution](/routesetting/assigning-distribution).

If you create a distribution using the app, you will see a list of draft climbs created when navigating to the corresponding gym area in the app.

If you created a distribution using the website, navigate to the gym area in the app and click "New Set" or "Edit Set" and click "Use Last Distribution" in the next screen. Scroll down and press "Save" and you will see a list of draft climbs in the gym area.
