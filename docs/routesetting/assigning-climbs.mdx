## Assigning Climbs to Setters

Once you have created a set of draft climbs, your setters can now select the climbs they want to set.

Head route setters can assign climbs to themselves or assign them to any of the other setters. Normal setters can only assign climbs to themselves and only if the climbs are less than or equal to the maximum grade they are allowed to set. To add route setters or change the maximum grade they can set, read the instruction on [Staff Permissions](/gym-management/staff-permissions)

### 1. Assign Climbs

Have all the route setters navigate to the setting screen and click the "Assign to Me" button to assign any route to them.

If you are the head route setter, click the "Assign to..." to assign a climb to any of the route setters.

If you wish to have more control over which setters set which routes, the head route setter can assign all climbs to each setter.

### Two Ways of Assigning Climbs

If you want to allow the setters to choose which climbs they want to set, you can allow all the route setters choose the routes themselves. The list of draft climbs will update every 3 seconds so that 2 setters won't accidentally try to assign the same climb to themselves.
