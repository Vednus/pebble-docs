## Resetting an Area

<VideoPlaylist videoId="ISSFIWjcvAs" />

Gyms tend to reset entire walls at once and the following instructions explain how to do that in Pebble. If you wish to selectively reset climbs, you can either manually delete and then add them using the trash button on the climb's row and then use the "Edit Set" button to add new climb(s).

For yet another option, allowing you to reset a wall selectively, while maintaining the distribution, but not having to adhere to setting the same grade you just stripped, check out the [Selective Setting](/routesetting/selective-setting) section of the docs.

### 1. Archive the current set.

Navigate to the gym area screen in the app corresponding to the area you want to reset and click the "Archive Set" button.

This will remvoe all the currently published climbs.

### 2. Create a new distribution.

Click the "Edit Set" or "New Set" button to create a new group of draft climbs based on a distribution. Click on the "Use Saved Distribution" to use the distribution set up for this area. You can use the form below to adjust the distribution if desired. For more info on distributions check out [Assigning a Grade Distribution](/routesetting/assigning-distributions)

### 3. Begin Setting!

Begin assinging climbs and setting as outlined in [Creating a Set of Climbs](/routesetting/creating-set)
