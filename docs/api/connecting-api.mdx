## Connecting to the Pebble API
Pebble's API is a GraphQL API so there is only one endpoint:

https://www.pebbleclimbing.com/.netlify/functions/graphql

In order to connect to this endpoint, you'll need to add a Bearer token to the authorization header of the request. Use the api key you generated and prefix it with "Bearer ".

There are many ways to connect to a graphql endpoint with numerous libraries created for the purpose, but you can also keep it simple and use a fetch request from a node server to query the endpoint, for example: 

```
const accessToken = 'YOUR_PEBBLE_API_KEY';
const query = `
query {
  getLatestRouteQualities(startDate: "2020-01-03 04:47:08.400Z", limit: 100) {
    cursor
    hasMore
    qualities {
      _id
      stars
      date
      route {
        _id
        name
      }
      user {
        _id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}`;

const response = await fetch('https://www.pebbleclimbing.com/.netlify/functions/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({query}),
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
  },
})
console.log('response: ', response)
  ```

Never use your api key to query the endpoint from a browser. Make sure that your api key is kept hidden from the public at all times.
